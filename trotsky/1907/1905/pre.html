<h2>Preface to the First Edition</h2>

<p class="fst"><span class="span">T</span>he events of 1905 formed a majestic prologue to the revolutionary drama of
    1917. For a number of years, when the reaction was triumphant, the year 1905 appeared to us as a completed whole, as
    <em>the Russian revolution</em>. Today it has lost that independent nature, without at the same time forfeiting any
    of its historical significance. The revolution of 1905 grew directly out of the <a
            href="../../../../glossary/events/r/u.htm#russo-japanese-war">Russo-Japanese War</a>, just as the revolution
    of 1917 was the direct outcome of the great imperialist slaughter. In this way, both in its origins and in its
    development the prologue carried within it all the elements of the historical drama whose witnesses and participants
    we are today. But in the prologue these elements appeared in a compressed, not as yet fully developed form. All the
    forces engaged in the struggle of 1905 are today illuminated more clearly than before by the light cast back on them
    by the events of 1917. The Red October, as we used to call it even then, grew after twelve years into another,
    incomparably more powerful and truly victorious <a href="../../../../history/ussr/events/revolution/index.htm">October</a>.
</p>

<p>Our great advantage in 1905 was the fact that even during this phase of revolutionary prologue, we <a
        href="../../../../glossary/terms/m/a.htm#marxist">Marxists</a> were already armed with the scientific method of
    comprehending historical processes. This enabled us to understand those relations which the material process of
    history revealed only as a series of hints. The chaotic July strikes of 1903 in the south of Russia had supplied us
    with material for concluding that a general strike of the <a href="../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.htm#proletariat">proletariat</a>
    with its subsequent transformation into an armed rising would become the fundamental form of the Russian revolution.
    The events of January 9, a vivid confirmation of this prognosis, demanded that the question of revolutionary power
    be raised in concrete fashion. From that moment on, the question of the nature of the Russian revolution and its
    inner class dynamic became a burning issue among the <a
            href="../../../../glossary/orgs/r/u.htm#russian-social-democratic-labour-party">Russian social democrats</a>
    of that time.</p>

<p>It was precisely in the interval between January 9 and the October strike of 1905 that those views which came to be
    called the theory of <a href="../../../../glossary/terms/p/e.htm#permanent-revolution">&#8220;permanent revolution&#8221;</a>
    were formed in the author&#8217;s mind. This rather high-flown expression defines the thought that the Russian
    revolution, although directly concerned with bourgeois aims, could not stop short at those aims; the revolution
    could not solve its immediate, bourgeois tasks except by putting the proletariat into power. And the proletariat,
    once having power in its hands, would not be able to remain confined within the bourgeois framework of the
    revolution. On the contrary, precisely in order to guarantee its victory, the proletarian vanguard in the very
    earliest stages of its rule would have to make extremely deep inroads not only into feudal but also into bourgeois
    property relations. While doing so it would enter into hostile conflict, not only with all those bourgeois groups
    which had supported it during the first stages of its revolutionary struggle, but also with the broad masses of the
    <a href="../../../../glossary/terms/p/e.htm#peasantry">peasantry</a>, with whose collaboration it &#8211; the
    proletariat &#8211; had come into power.</p>

<p>The contradictions between a workers&#8217; government and an overwhelming majority of peasants in a backward country
    could be resolved only on an international scale, in the arena of a world proletarian revolution. Having, by virtue
    of historical necessity, burst the narrow bourgeois-democratic confines of the Russian revolution, the victorious
    proletariat would be compelled also to burst its national and state confines, that is to say, it would have to
    strive consciously for the Russian revolution to become the prologue to a world revolution.</p>

<p>Despite an interruption of twelve years, this analysis has been entirely confirmed. The Russian revolution could not
    culminate in a bourgeois-democratic regime. It had to hand power over to the working class. In 1905, the working
    class was still too weak to seize power; but subsequent events forced it to gain maturity and strength, not in the
    environment of a bourgeois-democratic republic, but in the underground of the Tsarism of June 3. The proletariat
    came to power in 1917 with the help of the experience acquired by its older generation in 1905. That is why young
    workers today must have complete access to that experience and must, therefore, study the history of 1905.</p>

<p>As appendices to the first part of this book I have decided to print two articles, one of which (concerning
    Cherevanin&#8217;s book) was published in <a
            href="../../../../glossary/people/k/a.htm#kautsky-karl">Kautsky&#8217;s</a> journal <a
            href="../../../../glossary/periodicals/n/e.htm#neue-zeit"><strong>Neue Zeit</strong></a> in 1908; while the
    other, devoted to expounding the theory of &#8220;permanent revolution&#8221; and a polemic against views on this
    subject which were dominant within Russian social democracy at the time, was published (I believe in 1909) in a
    Polish party journal whose guiding spirits were <a href="../../../../glossary/people/l/u.htm#luxemburg-rosa">Rosa
        Luxemburg</a> and <a href="../../../../glossary/people/j/o.htm#leo-jogiches">Leo Jogiches</a>. It seems to me
    that these articles will not only make it easier for readers to orient themselves in the debate among Russian social
    democrats during the period directly following the first revolution, but will also shed a reflected light on certain
    extremely important problems of the present day. The seizure of power in October 1917 was by no means an
    improvisation as the ordinary citizen was inclined to believe, and the nationalization of factories and plants by
    the victorious working class was by no means an &#8220;error&#8220; of the workers&#8217; government which, it is
    said, failed to give timely heed to the warning voice of the <a href="../../../../glossary/orgs/m/e.htm#mensheviki">Mensheviks</a>.
    These matters were discussed, and were solved in principle, over a period of a decade and a half.</p>

<p>The debate over the character of the Russian revolution had, even during that period, gone beyond the confines of
    Russian social democracy and had engaged the attention of the leading elements of world socialism. The Menshevik
    conception of bourgeois revolution was expounded most conscientiously, that is to say, most badly and candidly, in
    Cherevanin&#8217;s book. As soon as it appeared, the German opportunists seized hold of it with glee. At Kautsky&#8217;s
    suggestion I wrote an analytical review of Cherevanin&#8217;s book in <strong>Neue Zeit</strong>. At the time,
    Kautsky himself fully identified himself with my views. Like Mehring (now deceased), he adopted the viewpoint of
    &#8220;permanent revolution.&#8221; Today, Kautsky has retrospectively joined the ranks of the Mensheviks. He wants
    to reduce his past to the level of his present. But this falsification, which satisfies the claims of an unclear
    theoretical conscience, is encountering obstacles in the form of printed documents. What Kautsky wrote in the
    earlier &#8211; the better! &#8211; period of his scientific and literary activity (his reply to the Polish
    socialist Ljusnia, his studies on Russian and American workers, his reply to <a
            href="../../../../glossary/people/p/l.htm">Plekhanov&#8217;s</a> questionnaire concerning the character of
    the Russian revolution, etc.) was and remains a merciless reaction of Menshevism and a complete theoretical
    vindication of the subsequent political tactics of the <a href="../../../../glossary/orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviki">Bolsheviks</a>,
    whom thick-heads and renegades, with Kautsky today at their head, accuse of adventurism, demagogy, and <a
            href="../../../../glossary/people/b/a.htm#bakunin">Bakuninism</a>.</p>

<p>As my third appendix I print the article <em>The Struggle for Power</em>, published in 1915 in the Paris newspaper <a
        href="../../../../glossary/periodicals/n/a.htm#nashe-slovo"><strong>Nashe Slovo</strong></a>, which is a
    presentation of the idea that those political relations which became clearly outlined in the first revolution must
    find their culmination and completion in the second.</p>

<p>This book lacks clarity on the question of formal democracy, as did the whole movement it describes. And this is not
    surprising: even ten years later, in 1917, our party was not yet completely clear in its own mind on this question.
    But this ambiguity, or lack of complete agreement, has nothing to do with matters of principle. In 1917 we were
    infinitely far removed from the mystique of democracy; we envisaged the progress of revolution, not as the putting
    into operation of certain absolute democratic norms, but as a war between classes which, for their temporary needs,
    had to make use of the slogans and the institutions of democracy. At that time, we directly advanced the slogan of
    the seizure of power by the working class, and we deduced the inevitability of this seizure of power, not from the
    chances of &#8220;democratic&#8221; election statistics, but from the correlation of class forces.</p>

<p>Even in 1905 the workers of Petersburg called their <a href="../../../../glossary/orgs/s/o.htm#soviets">Soviet</a> a
    proletarian government. The name became current and was entirely consistent with the program of struggle for the
    seizure of power by the working class. At the same time we opposed to Tsarism a developed program of political
    democracy (universal suffrage, republic, militia, etc.). And indeed we could not have done otherwise. Political
    democracy is an essential phase in the development of the working masses &#8211; with the important proviso that in
    some cases the working masses may remain in this phase for several decades, whereas in another case the
    revolutionary situation may enable the masses to liberate themselves from the prejudices of political democracy even
    before its institutions have come into being.</p>

<p>The state regime of the socialist revolutionaries and Mensheviks (March &#8211; October 1917) completely and utterly
    compromised democracy, even before it had time to be cast in any firm bourgeois-republican mold. And during that
    time, although having inscribed on our banner: &#8220;All power to the Soviets,&#8221; we were still formally
    supporting the slogans of democracy, unable as yet to give the masses (or even ourselves) a definite answer as to
    what would happen if the cogs of the wheels of formal democracy failed to mesh with the cogs of the Soviet system.
    During the time in which this book was written, and also much later, during the period of Kerensky&#8217;s rule, the
    essence of the task for us consisted in the actual seizure of power by the working class.</p>

<p>The formal, legalistic aspect of this process took second or third place, and we simply did not take the trouble to
    disentangle the formal contradictions at a time when the physical onslaught on the material obstacles still lay
    ahead.</p>

<p>The dispersal of the <a href="../../../../glossary/terms/c/o.htm#constituent-assembly">Constituent Assembly</a> was a
    crudely revolutionary fulfillment of an aim which might also have been reached by means of a postponement or by the
    preparation of elections. But it was precisely this peremptory attitude towards the legalistic aspect of the means
    of struggle that made the problem of revolutionary power inescapably acute; and, in its turn, the dispersal of the
    Constituent Assembly by the armed forces of the proletariat necessitated a complete reconsideration of the
    interrelationship between democracy and dictatorship. In the final analysis, this represented both a theoretical and
    a practical gain for the Workers&#8217; International.</p>

<p>The history of this book, very briefly, is as follows. It was written in Vienna in 1908-1909 for a German edition
    which appeared in Dresden. The German edition included certain chapters of my Russian book <strong>Our
        Revolution</strong> (1907), considerably modified and adapted for the non-Russian reader. The major part of the
    book was specially written for the German edition. I have now been obliged to reconstruct the text, partly on the
    basis of sections of the Russian manuscript still in existence, and partly by means of re-translating from the
    German. In this latter task I have been greatly helped by Comrade Ruhmer, who has done his work with extreme
    conscientiousness and care. I have revised the whole text and I hope that the reader will not be plagued with those
    innumerable mistakes, slips, misprints, and errors of all kinds which today are a constant feature of our
    publications.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Second Edition</h2>

<p class="fst">The present edition differs from the first Russian edition in two respects. 1) I have added the speech
    delivered by the author at the London party congress (1907) concerning the relationship of social democracy (as it
    then was) with the bourgeois parties involved in the revolution. 2) The volume now includes the author&#8217;s reply
    to Comrade Pokrovsky on the subject of the special features of Russia&#8217;s historical development.</p>

<h2>Preface to the German Edition</h2>

<p class="fst">The time has not yet come for an exhaustive historical appraisal of the Russian revolution; the relations
    are not yet sufficiently defined; the revolution continues, giving rise to new consequences all the time, and its
    full significance cannot be taken in at a glance. The book here presented to the reader does not claim to be a
    historical work; it represents the evidence of a witness and a participant, written while the traces of the events
    are still fresh in his mind, and illuminated from the author&#8217;s party viewpoint &#8211; the author being a
    social democrat <a id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> in politics and a Marxist in science. Above all, the author
    has attempted to make clear to the reader the revolutionary struggle of the Russian proletariat which found its
    culmination &#8211; and, at the same time, its tragic conclusion &#8211; in the activities of the Petersburg Soviet
    of Workers&#8217; Deputies. If he has succeeded in doing this, he will consider his main task to have been
    fulfilled.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The introduction is an analysis of the economic basis of the Russian revolution. It covers Tsarism,
    Russian capitalism, agrarian structure, production forms and relations, and social classes: the landowning nobility,
    the peasantry, large capital, the petty bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, the proletariat &#8211; in their
    relationships to one another and to the state. Such is the content of the &#8220;introduction,&#8221; the purpose of
    which is to show to the reader in their static form those social forces which, subsequently, will appear before him
    in their revolutionary dynamic.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The book makes no claim, either, to any completeness as to factual material. We have deliberately
    refrained from attempting to give a detailed description of the revolution in the country as a whole; within the
    limited framework of our work, we could, at best, have furnished a list of facts which might have been useful for
    reference purposes but would have told nothing of the inner logic of the events nor of the form they actually
    assumed in life. We chose a different method: having selected those events and institutions which, as it were,
    summed up the very meaning of the revolution, we have placed the center of the movement &#8211; Petersburg &#8211;
    at the center of our narrative. We leave the northern capital only to the extent that the revolution itself shifted
    its central arena to the shores of the Black Sea (<em>The Red Fleet</em>), to the villages (<em>The Peasant
        Riots</em>), and to Moscow (<em>December</em>).</p>

<p>Having thus limited ourselves in space, we were compelled also to limit ourselves in time.</p>

<p>We have devoted most of the available space to the last three months of 1905 &#8211; October, November, and December
    &#8211; the culminating period of the revolution, which began with the great all-Russian strike and ended with the
    crushing of the December rising in Moscow.</p>

<p>As to the preceding preparatory period, we have extracted from it two moments which arc essential for an
    understanding of the progress of events as a whole. In the first place, we have chosen to discuss the brief &#8220;era&#8221;
    of Prince Svyatopolk-Mirsky, that honeymoon of <em>rapprochement</em> between the government and &#8220;the public,&#8221;
    when trust was the general watchword and when government announcements and liberal leading articles alike were
    written with pens dipped in a sickening mixture of aniline and treacle. Secondly, we discuss January 9, the Red
    Sunday unequalled in dramatic horror, when the atmosphere so saturated with mutual confidence was suddenly pierced
    by the scream of bullets fired from guardsmen&#8217;s rifles and shattered forever by the curses of the proletarian
    masses. The comedy of the liberal spring had come to an end. The tragedy of revolution was beginning.</p>

<p>We pass over in almost complete silence the eight months between January and October. Interesting though that period
    was in itself, it does not add anything fundamentally new without which the history of the three decisive months of
    1905 might not be understood. The October strike was almost as much a direct consequence of the January procession
    to the Winter Palace as the December rising was a consequence of the October strike.</p>

<p>The final chapter of the historical part sums up the events of the revolutionary year, analyzes the method of
    revolutionary struggle and gives a brief description of the political developments of the three years that followed.
    The essential conclusion of this chapter can be expressed thus: <em>La r&#233;volution est morte, vive la r&#233;volution!</em>
</p>

<p>The chapter devoted to the October strike is dated November 1905. It was written during the final hours of the great
    strike which drove the ruling clique into a blind alley and forced Nicholas II to sign with trembling hand the
    manifesto of October 17. At the time, this chapter was published as an article in two issues of the Petersburg
    social-democratic paper <strong>Nachalo</strong>; it is reproduced here almost without change, not only because it
    draws the general picture of the strike with a degree of completeness sufficient for our present purpose, but also
    because by its very mood and tone it is, to some extent, characteristic of the political texts that were published
    in that period.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="fst">The second part of the book represents an independent whole. It is the history of the court trial of the
    Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies and, subsequently, of the author&#8217;s exile to Siberia and his escape
    therefrom. However, there is an inner link between the two parts of the book; not only because at the end of 1905
    the Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies stood at the very center of revolutionary events, but also, and
    above all, because its collective arrest marked the opening of the era of counter-revolution. One after the other,
    all revolutionary organizations throughout the country fell victim to the counter-revolution. Systematically, step
    by step, with ferocious determination and bloodthirsty vengefulness, the victors eradicated every trace of the great
    movement. And the less they were aware of any immediate danger, the more bloodthirsty became their contemptible
    vindictiveness. The Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies was brought before the court in 1906. The maximum
    sentence passed was privation of all civil rights and exile to Siberia for an unlimited period. The Yekaterinoslav
    Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies was not tried until 1909, but the results were very different: several dozen of
    the condemned were sentenced to forced labor and thirty-two death sentences were pronounced, of which eight were
    actually carried out.</p>

<p>After the titanic struggle and the temporary victory of the revolution came the epoch of liquidation: arrests,
    exiles, attempted escapes, dispersion over the entire world &#8211; and therein lies the connection between the two
    parts of my book. We conclude this preface by expressing our warmest gratitude to Mrs. Zarudnaya-Kavos, the
    well-known Petersburg artist, who put at our disposal her pencil sketches and pen drawings made during the court
    trial of the Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies.</p>
