<h4>列夫·托洛茨基</h4>

<h2>1905</h2>

<hr class="section"/>
<a id="fst" name="fst"></a>

<h2>第一版序言</h2>

<p class="fst"><span class="span">1905</span>年的事件是1917年革命戏剧的宏伟序幕。当反动派取得胜利的许多年来，1905年在我们看来是一个完整的整体，就像俄罗斯革命一样。
    今天，它失去了独立的性质，但没有丧失其任何历史意义。
    1905年的革命直接源于<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/r/u.htm#russo-japanese-war">日俄战争</a>，正如1917年的革命是帝国主义大屠杀的直接结果一样。
    因此，无论是在其起源还是在其发展过程中，这个序幕都带有所有我们作为参与者和见证者历史剧元素。
    但在序幕中，这些元素是被压缩的，还没有以完全成熟的形式出现。
    所有参与1905年斗争的力量今天都被1917年的反光照射的更加清晰。
    红色十月，就像我们之前所称的那样，经过十二年后逐渐发展成为另一个无比强大且真正胜利的<a
            href="https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/events/revolution/index.htm">十月</a>。
</p>

<p>我们在1905年的巨大优势在于，即使在革命序幕的这一阶段，我们<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#marxist">马克思主义者</a>已经被理解历史进程的科学方法武装了。
    这让我们可以理解这些历史的物质过程被以一系列暗示揭示了的的革命。 1903年俄国南部的罢工向我们表明，<a
            href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#proletariat">无产阶级</a>总罢工转变为武装起义将成为俄国革命的基本形式。
    1月9日的事件，生动地证实了这一预测，要求以具体的方式提出革命力量的问题。 从那一刻起，俄罗斯革命的性质及其内部阶级动态的问题成为当时<a
            href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/r/u.htm#russian-social-democratic-labour-party">俄国社会民主主义党</a>的一个亟待解决的问题。
</p>

<p>正是1905年1月9日到10月的罢工之间，作者的脑海中才形成被称为<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm#permanent-revolution">“不断革命论”</a>。
    这种相当高调的表达和定义了这样一种思想，即俄罗斯革命虽然直接关注资产阶级的目标，但却不能不减少这些目标；除了让无产阶级掌权之外，革命无法解决其直接的资产阶级任务。
    无产阶级一旦拥有权力，将无法继续被限制在资产阶级革命的框架内。相反，正是为了保证胜利，无产阶级先锋队在其统治的最初阶段必须极为深入地，不仅是对封建，也要对资产阶级的财产关系，进军。
    在这样做的同时，它将不仅会与在革命斗争的第一阶段支持它的所有那些资产阶级团体发生敌对冲突，而且还将会与广大的<a
            href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm#peasantry">农民</a>群众发生冲突。而无产阶级曾在他们帮助下掌握政权。
</p>

<p>工人政府与落后国家绝大多数农民之间的矛盾，只能在国际范围内，在世界无产阶级革命的舞台上解决。
    由于历史的必要性，破坏了俄国革命的狭隘的资产阶级民主制度，胜利的无产阶级也将被迫破坏其国家和国家的局限，也就是说，它必须有意识地努力让俄国革命成为世界革命的序幕。</p>

<p>尽管中断了十二年，但这一分析已经完全得到证实。 俄国革命无法达到资产阶级民主政权的高潮。 它必须将权力交给工人阶级。
    1905年，工人阶级仍然太弱，无法夺取政权; 但是后来，工人是在在6月3日沙皇的地下活动中，而不是在资产阶级民主共和国的环境中，被迫变得成熟和有力。
    在1917年，无产阶级借助其老一辈的经验获得了政权。 这就是为什么今天的年轻工人必须完全获得这种经验，因此必须研究1905年的历史。</p>

<p>作为本书第一部分的附录，我决定加上两篇文章，其中一篇（关于切列万宁的书）于1908年在<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/k/a.htm#kautsky-karl">考茨基</a>的期刊《<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/n/e.htm#neue-zeit">新时代</a>》上发表;
    而另一个，致力于阐述“不断革命论”和关于反对在当时俄国占主导地位的社会民主主义观点的论战，（我相信是在1909年）在<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/l/u.htm#luxemburg-rosa">罗莎·卢森堡</a>和<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/j/o.htm#leo-jogiches">雷奥·乔吉彻斯</a>为精神指导的波兰政党期刊上发表。
    在我看来，这些文章不仅会使读者更容易在紧跟着第一次革命后的俄罗斯社会民主党人的辩论中定位自己，而且还会反映出当今某些极其重要的问题。
    1917年10月夺取权力绝不是普通公民一般相信的即兴创作，胜利的工人阶级对工厂的国有化绝不是工人政府未能及时留意据<a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/m/e.htm#mensheviki">孟什维克</a>的警告的“错误”。
    这些问题在十五年的时间里进行了讨论，并在原则上得到了解决。
</p>

<p>The debate over the character of the Russian revolution had, even during that period, gone beyond the confines of
    Russian social democracy and had engaged the attention of the leading elements of world socialism. The Menshevik
    conception of bourgeois revolution was expounded most conscientiously, that is to say, most badly and candidly, in
    Cherevanin&#8217;s book. As soon as it appeared, the German opportunists seized hold of it with glee. At Kautsky&#8217;s
    suggestion I wrote an analytical review of Cherevanin&#8217;s book in <strong>Neue Zeit</strong>. At the time,
    Kautsky himself fully identified himself with my views. Like Mehring (now deceased), he adopted the viewpoint of
    &#8220;permanent revolution.&#8221; Today, Kautsky has retrospectively joined the ranks of the Mensheviks. He wants
    to reduce his past to the level of his present. But this falsification, which satisfies the claims of an unclear
    theoretical conscience, is encountering obstacles in the form of printed documents. What Kautsky wrote in the
    earlier &#8211; the better! &#8211; period of his scientific and literary activity (his reply to the Polish
    socialist Ljusnia, his studies on Russian and American workers, his reply to <a
            href="../../../../glossary/people/p/l.htm">Plekhanov&#8217;s</a> questionnaire concerning the character of
    the Russian revolution, etc.) was and remains a merciless reaction of Menshevism and a complete theoretical
    vindication of the subsequent political tactics of the <a href="../../../../glossary/orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviki">Bolsheviks</a>,
    whom thick-heads and renegades, with Kautsky today at their head, accuse of adventurism, demagogy, and <a
            href="../../../../glossary/people/b/a.htm#bakunin">Bakuninism</a>.</p>

<p>As my third appendix I print the article <em>The Struggle for Power</em>, published in 1915 in the Paris newspaper <a
        href="../../../../glossary/periodicals/n/a.htm#nashe-slovo"><strong>Nashe Slovo</strong></a>, which is a
    presentation of the idea that those political relations which became clearly outlined in the first revolution must
    find their culmination and completion in the second.</p>

<p>This book lacks clarity on the question of formal democracy, as did the whole movement it describes. And this is not
    surprising: even ten years later, in 1917, our party was not yet completely clear in its own mind on this question.
    But this ambiguity, or lack of complete agreement, has nothing to do with matters of principle. In 1917 we were
    infinitely far removed from the mystique of democracy; we envisaged the progress of revolution, not as the putting
    into operation of certain absolute democratic norms, but as a war between classes which, for their temporary needs,
    had to make use of the slogans and the institutions of democracy. At that time, we directly advanced the slogan of
    the seizure of power by the working class, and we deduced the inevitability of this seizure of power, not from the
    chances of &#8220;democratic&#8221; election statistics, but from the correlation of class forces.</p>

<p>Even in 1905 the workers of Petersburg called their <a href="../../../../glossary/orgs/s/o.htm#soviets">Soviet</a> a
    proletarian government. The name became current and was entirely consistent with the program of struggle for the
    seizure of power by the working class. At the same time we opposed to Tsarism a developed program of political
    democracy (universal suffrage, republic, militia, etc.). And indeed we could not have done otherwise. Political
    democracy is an essential phase in the development of the working masses &#8211; with the important proviso that in
    some cases the working masses may remain in this phase for several decades, whereas in another case the
    revolutionary situation may enable the masses to liberate themselves from the prejudices of political democracy even
    before its institutions have come into being.</p>

<p>The state regime of the socialist revolutionaries and Mensheviks (March &#8211; October 1917) completely and utterly
    compromised democracy, even before it had time to be cast in any firm bourgeois-republican mold. And during that
    time, although having inscribed on our banner: &#8220;All power to the Soviets,&#8221; we were still formally
    supporting the slogans of democracy, unable as yet to give the masses (or even ourselves) a definite answer as to
    what would happen if the cogs of the wheels of formal democracy failed to mesh with the cogs of the Soviet system.
    During the time in which this book was written, and also much later, during the period of Kerensky&#8217;s rule, the
    essence of the task for us consisted in the actual seizure of power by the working class.</p>

<p>The formal, legalistic aspect of this process took second or third place, and we simply did not take the trouble to
    disentangle the formal contradictions at a time when the physical onslaught on the material obstacles still lay
    ahead.</p>

<p>The dispersal of the <a href="../../../../glossary/terms/c/o.htm#constituent-assembly">Constituent Assembly</a> was a
    crudely revolutionary fulfillment of an aim which might also have been reached by means of a postponement or by the
    preparation of elections. But it was precisely this peremptory attitude towards the legalistic aspect of the means
    of struggle that made the problem of revolutionary power inescapably acute; and, in its turn, the dispersal of the
    Constituent Assembly by the armed forces of the proletariat necessitated a complete reconsideration of the
    interrelationship between democracy and dictatorship. In the final analysis, this represented both a theoretical and
    a practical gain for the Workers&#8217; International.</p>

<p>The history of this book, very briefly, is as follows. It was written in Vienna in 1908-1909 for a German edition
    which appeared in Dresden. The German edition included certain chapters of my Russian book <strong>Our
        Revolution</strong> (1907), considerably modified and adapted for the non-Russian reader. The major part of the
    book was specially written for the German edition. I have now been obliged to reconstruct the text, partly on the
    basis of sections of the Russian manuscript still in existence, and partly by means of re-translating from the
    German. In this latter task I have been greatly helped by Comrade Ruhmer, who has done his work with extreme
    conscientiousness and care. I have revised the whole text and I hope that the reader will not be plagued with those
    innumerable mistakes, slips, misprints, and errors of all kinds which today are a constant feature of our
    publications.</p>

<h2>第二版序言</h2>

<p class="fst">第二版在两个方面与俄文第一版不同。
    一、我添加了作者在伦敦党代表大会（1907年）上发表的讲话，内容涉及在革命时期（当时的）社会民主党与资产阶级政党之间的关系。
    二、该卷现在包括作者对波克罗夫斯基同志关于俄国历史发展特点的回复。

<h2>Preface to the German Edition</h2>

<p class="fst">The time has not yet come for an exhaustive historical appraisal of the Russian revolution; the relations
    are not yet sufficiently defined; the revolution continues, giving rise to new consequences all the time, and its
    full significance cannot be taken in at a glance. The book here presented to the reader does not claim to be a
    historical work; it represents the evidence of a witness and a participant, written while the traces of the events
    are still fresh in his mind, and illuminated from the author&#8217;s party viewpoint &#8211; the author being a
    social democrat <a id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> in politics and a Marxist in science. Above all, the author
    has attempted to make clear to the reader the revolutionary struggle of the Russian proletariat which found its
    culmination &#8211; and, at the same time, its tragic conclusion &#8211; in the activities of the Petersburg Soviet
    of Workers&#8217; Deputies. If he has succeeded in doing this, he will consider his main task to have been
    fulfilled.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The introduction is an analysis of the economic basis of the Russian revolution. It covers Tsarism,
    Russian capitalism, agrarian structure, production forms and relations, and social classes: the landowning nobility,
    the peasantry, large capital, the petty bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, the proletariat &#8211; in their
    relationships to one another and to the state. Such is the content of the &#8220;introduction,&#8221; the purpose of
    which is to show to the reader in their static form those social forces which, subsequently, will appear before him
    in their revolutionary dynamic.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The book makes no claim, either, to any completeness as to factual material. We have deliberately
    refrained from attempting to give a detailed description of the revolution in the country as a whole; within the
    limited framework of our work, we could, at best, have furnished a list of facts which might have been useful for
    reference purposes but would have told nothing of the inner logic of the events nor of the form they actually
    assumed in life. We chose a different method: having selected those events and institutions which, as it were,
    summed up the very meaning of the revolution, we have placed the center of the movement &#8211; Petersburg &#8211;
    at the center of our narrative. We leave the northern capital only to the extent that the revolution itself shifted
    its central arena to the shores of the Black Sea (<em>The Red Fleet</em>), to the villages (<em>The Peasant
        Riots</em>), and to Moscow (<em>December</em>).</p>

<p>Having thus limited ourselves in space, we were compelled also to limit ourselves in time.</p>

<p>We have devoted most of the available space to the last three months of 1905 &#8211; October, November, and December
    &#8211; the culminating period of the revolution, which began with the great all-Russian strike and ended with the
    crushing of the December rising in Moscow.</p>

<p>As to the preceding preparatory period, we have extracted from it two moments which arc essential for an
    understanding of the progress of events as a whole. In the first place, we have chosen to discuss the brief &#8220;era&#8221;
    of Prince Svyatopolk-Mirsky, that honeymoon of <em>rapprochement</em> between the government and &#8220;the public,&#8221;
    when trust was the general watchword and when government announcements and liberal leading articles alike were
    written with pens dipped in a sickening mixture of aniline and treacle. Secondly, we discuss January 9, the Red
    Sunday unequalled in dramatic horror, when the atmosphere so saturated with mutual confidence was suddenly pierced
    by the scream of bullets fired from guardsmen&#8217;s rifles and shattered forever by the curses of the proletarian
    masses. The comedy of the liberal spring had come to an end. The tragedy of revolution was beginning.</p>

<p>We pass over in almost complete silence the eight months between January and October. Interesting though that period
    was in itself, it does not add anything fundamentally new without which the history of the three decisive months of
    1905 might not be understood. The October strike was almost as much a direct consequence of the January procession
    to the Winter Palace as the December rising was a consequence of the October strike.</p>

<p>The final chapter of the historical part sums up the events of the revolutionary year, analyzes the method of
    revolutionary struggle and gives a brief description of the political developments of the three years that followed.
    The essential conclusion of this chapter can be expressed thus: <em>La r&#233;volution est morte, vive la r&#233;volution!</em>
</p>

<p>The chapter devoted to the October strike is dated November 1905. It was written during the final hours of the great
    strike which drove the ruling clique into a blind alley and forced Nicholas II to sign with trembling hand the
    manifesto of October 17. At the time, this chapter was published as an article in two issues of the Petersburg
    social-democratic paper <strong>Nachalo</strong>; it is reproduced here almost without change, not only because it
    draws the general picture of the strike with a degree of completeness sufficient for our present purpose, but also
    because by its very mood and tone it is, to some extent, characteristic of the political texts that were published
    in that period.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="fst">The second part of the book represents an independent whole. It is the history of the court trial of the
    Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies and, subsequently, of the author&#8217;s exile to Siberia and his escape
    therefrom. However, there is an inner link between the two parts of the book; not only because at the end of 1905
    the Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies stood at the very center of revolutionary events, but also, and
    above all, because its collective arrest marked the opening of the era of counter-revolution. One after the other,
    all revolutionary organizations throughout the country fell victim to the counter-revolution. Systematically, step
    by step, with ferocious determination and bloodthirsty vengefulness, the victors eradicated every trace of the great
    movement. And the less they were aware of any immediate danger, the more bloodthirsty became their contemptible
    vindictiveness. The Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies was brought before the court in 1906. The maximum
    sentence passed was privation of all civil rights and exile to Siberia for an unlimited period. The Yekaterinoslav
    Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies was not tried until 1909, but the results were very different: several dozen of
    the condemned were sentenced to forced labor and thirty-two death sentences were pronounced, of which eight were
    actually carried out.</p>

<p>After the titanic struggle and the temporary victory of the revolution came the epoch of liquidation: arrests,
    exiles, attempted escapes, dispersion over the entire world &#8211; and therein lies the connection between the two
    parts of my book. We conclude this preface by expressing our warmest gratitude to Mrs. Zarudnaya-Kavos, the
    well-known Petersburg artist, who put at our disposal her pencil sketches and pen drawings made during the court
    trial of the Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies.</p>
