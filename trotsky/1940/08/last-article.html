<!--TODO: part of it merely as notations for later elaboration译作“后期工作的注释”似乎不是很合理-->
<p class="fst"><em>托洛茨基同志从文以书面形式见过这篇文章。他按照他的习惯把此文通过口述录入他的录音机，其中的一部分仅仅是为后期工作的注释。
    更深入的内容会在后面出现，内容自然的会前后颠倒，一些段落会完全删除，一些段落会散落在手稿的各个位置等等。
    所以，和流行的神话相反，虽然托洛茨基的著作很多，但他不轻易写东西。
    因此下面的内容是他的俄国速记员根据托洛茨基的录音进行文案翻译的内容。
    尽管是未完成的状态，这篇文章仍然是托洛茨基最重要的文献之一。
    他更加准确和尖锐的认清只有在群众激进化并且无产阶级先锋队没能领导激进的群众争夺取政权之后法西斯才能成功的历史规律。
    每一位认真的读者都会清楚这一概念的重要性。尤其是对美国工人而言。</em>

<p class="fst">在他自大的混乱的愚蠢的文章<span class="inote">[<em>国防: 社会主义案例</em>，<strong>党派评论</strong>，1940年七月-八月]</span>
    德怀特·麦克唐纳试图让我们认为法西斯主义只是波拿巴主义的重演。 很难找出比这更荒谬的废话了。
    我们从各个方面分析了法西斯主义的最终形态、各个发展阶段、当前最新的发展。
    法西斯主义带有波拿巴主义元素。没有这种元素，法西斯主义就是不可能的。或者说，如果不将国家权力置于社会之上，由于及其尖锐的阶级斗争，法西斯主义就是不可能的。
    但是我们一开始就指出：帝国主义衰落时期的波拿巴主义的主要问题和资本主义上升时期的波拿巴主义的主要问题有着本质的不同。
    在下一章，我们将纯粹的波拿巴主义分离出来以作为法西斯主义的序幕。
    因为纯粹的波拿巴主义的统治和君主的统治是很相近的，并且……
</p>

<p>用斜体 ...</p>

<p>战后的意大利，情况极具革命性。无产阶级有一切机会。</p>

<!--TODO: crush the proletariat under its weight 中 under its weight不知道怎么翻译 -->
<p>布朗宁，施莱歇尔和德国兴登堡总统，法国佩恩政府，但他们都证明或必然是不稳定的。
    在帝国主义衰落的时代，纯粹的波拿巴主义是不合时宜的。帝国主义发现动员小资产阶级和粉碎无产阶级是必要的。
    只有在无产阶级本身显示出无力夺取政权，社会危机迫使小资产阶级歇斯底里。
</p>

<p>社会危机的尖锐性源于现在的生产资料集中，如信用，价值规律的垄断 &#8211; 市场已经无法调节经济关系。国家干预成为绝对必要的。因为无产阶级…… </p>

<p>正如我们不止一次的指出的那样，现在的战争是上一次战争的延续。但是延续并不意味着重复。作为一般的规则，延续意味着进一步发展、深化和尖锐化。
    我们的政策，即革命无产阶级对第二次帝国主义战争的政策，主要是在列宁的领导下，是在上一次帝国主义战争期间制定的政策的延续。
    但是延续并不意味着重复。在这个情况也是一样，延续意味着进一步发展、深化和尖锐化。
</p>

<br/>


<h4>我们再1914年忽略的</h4>

<p class="fst">在上一次战争中，不只是整个无产阶级，连他的先锋队，某种程度上他的先锋队的先锋队都没有意识到。
    对战时革命政策原则的阐述始于战争已经全面开火并且战争机器行使无限制的统治时。
    战争爆发一年后，革命的少数派仍被迫栖身于齐默尔瓦尔德会议上的多数中间派。
    在二月革命之前甚至之后，革命分子认为自己不是政权的竞争者，而是极端的左翼反对派。
    甚至列宁也或多或少的把社会主义革命推到遥远的未来。
    （1915年或者1916年）他在瑞士写道：（引用）。<a id="bk01" href="#fw01" name="bk01"><span class="enote">[1]</span></a>
    如果这就是列宁对时局的看法，那么几乎没有必要再谈论其他人了。</p>

<p>国防问题最直观的表明了极左翼的政治立场。</p>

<p>1915年，列宁在他的著作中提到了胜利的无产阶级必须发动革命战争。但是这是一个无限期的历史观点而不是一个明天的任务。
    革命派的注意力集中在保卫资本主义祖国的问题上。革命者自然而然的对这个问题给出负面回答。这是完全正确的。
    但是这个纯粹负面的回答仅仅是为了宣传和对干部的训练。但这不能赢得不想要一个外来征服者的群众。
    在战争前的俄罗斯，布尔什维克占无产阶级先锋队中的五分之四，即参与政治生活的工人（报纸、选举等）。
    接下来的二月革命中，无限的统治权传递到了卫国者、孟什维克和SR的手中。
    确实如此，布尔什维克在八个月内争取到了绝大多数的工人。
    但是在争取群众中起决定性作用的不是拒绝包围资产阶级祖国，而是且仅是“一切权力归苏维埃”的革命性口号。
    对于帝国主义，军国主义，放弃捍卫资产阶级民主等等的批评从来没有把压倒性的多数争取到布尔什维克的一边。
    在所有交战国中，除了俄国，革命即将结束战争……
</p>

<p>到目前为止，无产阶级被证明无法夺取政权，帝国主义就开始用它自己的方式规范经济生活。成为国家机器法西斯党就是它的政治机制。
    生产力不仅与私有财产有着不可调和的矛盾，而且与国家的国家边界也有着不可调和的矛盾。帝国主义就是这种矛盾的表现。
    资本主义的帝国主义者希望通过扩展边检，夺取新的领土等来解决这个矛盾。
    极权主义国家，将经济，政治和文化生活的各个方面都用于经济资本，是建立超民族主义国家，帝国主义帝国，统治大陆，统治全世界的工具。
</p>

<p>所有这些法西斯主义的特征我们已经对其本身逐个分析过了，所有这些总的来说使他们得到展示或走到前列。</p>

<br/>


<h4>法西斯主义成功的关键</h4>

<p class="fst">理论分析和过去四分之一世纪的丰富经验同时表明，法西斯主义总是以以下特征构成特殊政治周期中的最后一环：
    资本主义社会最严重的危机；
    工人阶级进一步激进化；
    农村和城市小资产阶级对工人阶级的同情和对变革的渴望的增长；
    大资产阶级极度混乱；
    通过懦弱和危险的演习来避免革命的高潮;
    无产阶级的疲惫，日益混乱和漠不关心；
    社会危机的加剧；
    小资产阶级的绝望，对改变的渴望，小资产阶级的集体神经质，愿意相信奇迹；
    准备采取暴力措施；
    用对无产阶级增长的敌意欺骗了他的期望；
    这些是迅速组建法西斯政党及其胜利的前提。
</p>

<p>不言而喻，美国工人阶级的激进化只是通过其初始阶段，几乎完全是在工会运动（CIO）领域。
    战争前期和后来战争本身可能暂时中断这一激进化的进程，特别是在数目可观的工人被吸收进战争工厂的情况下。
    但是这种激进化过程的终端不可能持续很长时间。
    激进化进程的第二阶段j将更具表现力。
    组建独立的工党的问题将被提上日程。我们的过渡性需求将获得极大的欢迎。
    另一方面，法西斯主义，反动的倾向将退到后台，采取一个防御位置，等待一个更有利的时机。这是最近的视角。
    没有任何职业比推测我们能不能成功建立一个有力的领导革命党更没有价值。
    前方是有利的观点，为革命活动提供了所有理由。
    有必要利用开放的机会，建设革命党。
</p>

<br/>


<h4>工人面临的政权问题</h4>

<p class="fst">第二次世界大战比第一次世界大战更傲慢更紧迫的提出了改变制度的问题。这首先是政治制度的问题。
    工人们意识到民主在各地失事，即使在法西斯主义不存在的国家，他们也感受到法西斯主义的威胁。
    民主国家的资产阶级自然会利用工人对法西斯主义的这种恐惧，但另一方面，民主国家的破产、崩溃、无痛的转变为反动的独裁政权，迫使工人摆出政权问题并对此做出反应。
</p>

<p>今天的反应在人类的现代历史中可能具有前所未有的力量。但只看到反应是不可原谅的错误。历史进程是矛盾的。
    在官方反应的掩盖下，正在积累经验并正在接受新的政治观点的群众中正在发生深刻的转变。
    即使在最后一次帝国主义战争时期，民主国家的古老保守传统在今天仍然存在，只是极其不稳定。
    在上一次战争前夕，欧洲工人拥有数量众多的政党。
    但是当时的秩序是改革，部分夺取，而不是完全夺取证政权。
</p>

<p>The American working class is still without a mass labor party even today. But the objective situation and the
    experience accumulated by the American workers can pose within a very brief period of time on the order of the day
    the question of the conquest of power. This perspective must be made the basis of our agitation. It is not merely a
    question of a position on capitalist militarism and of renouncing the defense of the bourgeois state but of directly
    preparing for the conquest of power and the defense of the proletarian fatherland.</p>

<p>May not the Stalinists turn out at the head of a new revolutionary upsurge and may they not ruin the revolution as
    they did in Spain and previously in China? It is of course impermissible to consider that such a possibility is
    excluded, for example in France. The first wave of the revolution has often, or more correctly, always carried to
    the top those &#8220;left&#8221; parties which have not managed to discredit themselves completely in the preceding
    period and which have an imposing political tradition behind them. Thus the February revolution raised up the
    Mensheviks, the S. R.&#8217;s who were the opponents of the revolution on its very eve. Thus the German revolution
    in November, 1918, raised to power the social democrats who were the irreconcilable opponents of revolutionary
    uprisings.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago Trotsky wrote in an article published by <strong>The New Republic</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is no epoch in human history so saturated with antagonisms as ours. Under a too high
    tension of class and international animosities, the &#8216;fuses&#8217; of democracy &#8216;blow out&#8217;. Hence
    the short-circuits of dictatorship. Naturally the weakest &#8216;interrupters&#8217; are the first to give way. But
    the force of internal and world controversies does not weaken: it grows. It is doubtful if it is destined to calm
    down, given that the process has so far only taken hold of the periphery of the capitalist world. Gout begins in the
    little finger of a hand or in the big toe, but once on the way it goes right to the heart.&#8221; (<strong>The New
        Republic</strong>, May 22, 1929)</p>

<br/>


<h4>The American Philistine Protests</h4>

<p class="fst">This was written at a time when the entire bourgeois democracy in each country believed that fascism was
    possible only in the backward countries which had not yet graduated from the school of democracy. The editorial
    board of <strong>The New Republic</strong>, which at that period had not yet been touched with the blessings of the
    GPU, accompanied Trotsky&#8217;s article with one of its own. The article is so characteristic of the average
    American philistine that we shall quote from it the most interesting passages.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In view of his personal misfortunes, the exiled Russian leader shows a remarkable power of
    detached analysis; but his detachment is that of the rigid Marxian, and seems to us to lack a realistic view of
    history-the very thing on which he prides himself. His notion that democracy is a fair-weather form of government,
    incapable of withstanding the storms of international or domestic controversy, can be supported (as he himself half
    admits) only by taking for your examples countries where democracy has never made more than the feeblest beginnings,
    and countries, moreover, in which the industrial revolution has hardly more than started.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Further on, the editorial board of <strong>The New Republic</strong> dismisses the instance of Kerensky&#8217;s
    democracy in Soviet Russia and why it failed to withstand the test of class contradictions arid yielded place to a
    revolutionary perspective. The periodical sagely writes:</p>

<p class="quotbe">&#8220;Kerensky&#8217;s weakness was an historic accident, which Trotsky cannot admit because there is
    no room in his mechanistic scheme for any such thing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Just like Dwight Macdonald, <strong>The New Republic</strong> accused the Marxists of being unable to
    understand history realistically owing to their orthodox or mechanistic approach to political events. <strong>The
        New Republic</strong> was of the opinion that fascism is the product of the backwardness of capitalism and not
    its over-ripeness. In the opinion of that periodical which, I repeat, was the opinion of the overwhelming majority
    of average democratic philistines, fascism is the lot of backward bourgeois countries. The sage editorial board did
    not even take the trouble of thinking about the question of why it was the universal conviction in the Nineteenth
    Century that backward countries must develop along the road of democracy. In any case, in the old capitalist
    countries democracy came into its sights at a time when the level of their economic development was not above but
    below the economic development of modern Italy. And what is more, in that era democracy represented the main highway
    of historical development which was entered by all countries one by one, the backward ones following the more
    advanced, and sometimes ahead of them. Our era on the contrary, is the era of democracy&#8217;s collapse, and
    moreover, the collapse begins with the weaker links but gradually extends to those which appeared strong and
    impregnable. Thus the orthodox or mechanistic, that is, the Marxist approach to events enabled us to forecast the
    course of developments many years in advance. On the contrary, the realistic approach of <strong>The New
        Republic</strong> represented the approach of a blind kitten. <strong>The New Republic</strong> followed up its
    critical attitude toward Marxism by falling under the influence of the most revolting caricature of Marxism, namely,
    Stalinism.</p>

<br/>


<h4>The Newest Crop of Philistines</h4>

<p class="fst">Most of the philistines of the newest crop base their attacks on Marxism on the fact that contrary to
    Marx&#8217;s prognosis fascism came instead of socialism. Nothing is more stupid and vulgar than this criticism.
    Marx demonstrated and proved that when capitalism reaches a certain level the only way out for society lies in the
    socialization of the means of production, i.e., socialism. He also demonstrated that in view of the class structure
    of society the proletariat alone is capable of solving this task in an irreconcilable revolutionary struggle against
    the bourgeoisie. He further demonstrated that for the fulfillment of this task the proletariat needs a revolutionary
    party. All his life Marx, and together with him and after him Engels, and after them Lenin, waged an irreconcilable
    struggle against those traits in proletarian parties, socialist parties which obstructed the solution of the
    revolutionary historical task. The irreconcilability of the struggle waged by Marx, Engels, and Lenin against
    opportunism, on the one side, and anarchism, on the other, demonstrates that they did not at all underestimate this
    danger. In what did it consist? In this, that the opportunism of the summits of the working class, subject to the
    bourgeoisie&#8217;s influence, could obstruct, slow down, make more difficult, postpone the fulfillment of the
    revolutionary task of the proletariat. It is precisely this condition of society that we are now observing. Fascism
    did not at all come &#8220;instead&#8221; of socialism. Fascism is the continuation of capitalism, an attempt to
    perpetuate its existence by means of the most bestial and monstrous measures. Capitalism obtained an opportunity to
    resort to fascism only because the proletariat did not accomplish the socialist revolution in time. The proletariat
    was paralyzed in the fulfillment of its task by the opportunist parties. The only thing that can be said is that
    there turned out to be more obstacles, more difficulties, more stages on the road of the revolutionary development
    of the proletariat than was foreseen by the founders of scientific socialism. Fascism and the series of imperialist
    wars constitute the terrible school in which the proletariat has to free itself of petty bourgeois traditions and
    superstitions, has to rid itself of opportunist, democratic and adventurist parties, has to hammer out and train the
    revolutionary vanguard and in this way prepare for the solving of the task apart from which there is not, and cannot
    be, any salvation for the development of mankind.</p>

<p>Eastman, if you please, has come to the conclusion that the concentration of the means of production in the hands of
    the state endangers his &#8220;freedom&#8221; and he has therefore decided to renounce socialism. This anecdote
    deserves being included in the text of a history of ideology. The socialization of the means of production is the
    only solution to the economic problem at the given stage of mankind&#8217;s development. The delay in solving this
    problem leads to the barbarism of fascism. All the intermediate solutions undertaken by the bourgeoisie with the
    help of the petty bourgeoisie have suffered a miserable and shameful fiasco. All this is absolutely uninteresting to
    Eastman. He noticed that his &#8220;freedom&#8221; (freedom of muddling, freedom of indifferentism, freedom of
    passivity, freedom of literary dilettantism) was being threatened from various sides, and he decided immediately to
    apply his own measure: renounce socialism. Astonishingly enough this decision exercised no influence either on Wall
    Street or on the policy of the trade unions. Life went its own way just as if Max Eastman had remained a socialist.
    It may be set down as a general rule that the more impotent is a petty bourgeois radical especially in the United
    States the more.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Fascism Has Not Conquered in France</h4>

<p class="fst">In France there is no fascism in the real sense of the term. The regime of the senile Marshal Petain
    represents a senile form of Bonapartism of the epoch of imperialist decline. But this regime too proved possible
    only after the prolonged radicalization of the French working class, which led to the explosion of June 1936, had
    failed to find a revolutionary way out. The Second and Third Internationals, the reactionary charlatanism of the
    &#8220;People&#8217;s Fronts&#8221; deceived and demoralized the working class. After five years of propaganda in
    favor of an alliance of democracies and of collective security, after Stalin&#8217;s sudden passage into Hitler&#8217;s
    camp, the French working class proved caught unaware. The war provoked a terrible disorientation and the mood of
    passive defeatism, or to put it more correctly, the indifferentism of an impasse. From this web of circumstances
    arose first the unprecedented military catastrophe and then the despicable Petain regime.</p>

<p>Precisely because Petain&#8217;s regime is senile Bonapartism, it contains no element of stability and can be
    overthrown by a revolutionary mass uprising much sooner than a fascist regime.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Especially Important to US Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">In every discussion of political topics the question invariably flares up: Shall we succeed in creating a
    strong party for the moment when the crisis comes? Might not fascism anticipate us? Isn&#8217;t a fascist stage of
    development inevitable? The successes of fascism easily make people lose all perspective, lead them to forget the
    actual conditions which made the strengthening and the victory of fascism possible. Yet a clear understanding of
    these conditions is of special importance to the workers of the United States. We may set it down as an historical
    law: Fascism was able to conquer only in those countries where the conservative labor parties prevented the
    proletariat from utilizing the revolutionary situation and seizing power. In Germany two revolutionary situations
    were involved: 1918-1919 and 1923-24. Even in 1929 a direct struggle for power on the part of the proletariat was
    still possible. In all these three cases the social democracy and the Comintern criminally and viciously disrupted
    the conquest of power and thereby placed society in an impasse. Only under these conditions and in this situation
    did the stormy rise of Fascism and its gaining of power prove possible.</p>
