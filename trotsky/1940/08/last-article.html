    德怀特·麦克唐纳试图让我们认为法西斯主义只是波拿巴主义的重演。 很难找出比这更荒谬的废话了。
    我们从各个方面分析了法西斯主义的最终形态、各个发展阶段、当前最新的发展。
    法西斯主义带有波拿巴主义元素。没有这种元素，法西斯主义就是不可能的。或者说，如果不将国家权力置于社会之上，由于及其尖锐的阶级斗争，法西斯主义就是不可能的。
    但是我们一开始就指出：帝国主义衰落时期的波拿巴主义的主要问题和资本主义上升时期的波拿巴主义的主要问题有着本质的不同。
    在下一章，我们将纯粹的波拿巴主义分离出来以作为法西斯主义的序幕。
    因为纯粹的波拿巴主义的统治和君主的统治是很相近的，并且……

<h4>We Were Caught Unaware in 1914</h4>

<p class="fst">During the last war not only the proletariat as a whole but also its vanguard and, in a certain sense,
    the vanguard of this vanguard was caught unaware. The elaboration of the principles of revolutionary policy toward
    the war began at a time when the war was already in full blaze and the military machine exercised unlimited rule.
    One year after the outbreak of the war, the small revolutionary minority was still compelled to accommodate itself
    to a centrist majority at the Zimmerwald Conference. Prior to the February revolution and even afterwards, the
    revolutionary elements felt themselves to be not contenders for power but the extreme left opposition. Even Lenin
    relegated the socialist revolution to a more or less distant future. (In 1915 or 1916) he wrote in Switzerland:
    (quotation). <a id="bk01" href="#fw01" name="bk01"><span class="enote">[1]</span></a> If that is how Lenin viewed
    the situation, then there is hardly any need of talking about the others.</p>

<p>This political position of the extreme left wing expressed itself most graphically on the question of the defense of
    the fatherland.</p>

<p>In 1915 Lenin referred in his writings to revolutionary wars which the victorious proletariat would have to wage. But
    it was a question of an indefinite historical perspective and not of tomorrow&#8217;s task. The attention of the
    revolutionary wing was centered on the question of the defense of the capitalist fatherland. The revolutionists
    naturally replied to this question in the negative. This was entirely correct. But this purely negative answer
    served as the basis for propaganda and for training the cadres but it could not win the masses who did not want a
    foreign conquerer. In Russia prior to the war the Bolsheviks constituted four-fifths of the proletarian vanguard,
    that is, of the workers participating in political life (newspapers, elections, etc.). Following the February
    revolution the unlimited rule passed into the hands of defensists, the Mensheviks and the SR&#8217;s. True enough,
    the Bolsheviks in the space of eight months conquered the overwhelming majority of the workers. But the decisive
    role in this conquest was played not by the refusal to defend the bourgeois fatherland but by the slogan: &#8220;All
    Power to the Soviets!&#8221; And only by this revolutionary slogan! The criticism of imperialism, its militarism,
    the renunciation of the defense of bourgeois delnocracy and so on could have never conquered the overwhelming
    majority of the people to the side of the Bolsheviks. In all other belligerent countries, with the exception of
    Russia the revolutionary wing toward the end of the war all ...</p>

<p>In so far as the proletariat proves incapable at a given stage of conquering power, imperialism begins regulating
    economic life with its own methods; the fascist party which becomes the state power is the political mechanism. The
    productive forces are in irreconcilable contradiction not only with private property but also with national state
    boundaries. Imperialism is the very expression of this contradiction. Imperialist capitalism seeks to solve this
    contradiction through an extension of boundaries, seizure of new territories, and so on. The totalitarian state,
    subjecting all aspects of economic, political and cultural life to finance capital, is the instrument for creating a
    super-nationalist state, an imperialist empire, the rule over continents, the rule over the whole world.</p>

<p>All these traits of fascism we have analyzed each one by itself and all of them in their totality to the extent that
    they became manifest or came to the forefront.</p>

<br/>


<h4>The Point at Which Fascism Succeeds</h4>

<p class="fst">Both theoretical analysis as well as the rich historical experience of the last quarter of a century have
    demonstrated with equal force that fascism is each time the final link of a specific political cycle composed of the
    following: the gravest crisis of capitalist society; the growth of the radicalization of the working class; the
    growth of sympathy toward the working class and a yearning for change on the part of the rural and urban petty
    bourgeoisie; the extreme confusion of the big bourgeoisie; its cowardly and treacherous maneuvers aimed at avoiding
    the revolutionary climax; the exhaustion of the proletariat, growing confusion and indifference; the aggravation of
    the social crisis; the despair of the petty bourgeoisie, its yearning for change, the collective neurosis of the
    petty bourgeoisie, its readiness to believe in miracles; its readiness for violent measures; the growth of hostility
    towards the proletariat which has deceived its expectations. These are the premises for a swift formation of a
    fascist party and its victory.</p>

<p>It is quite self-evident that the radicalization of the working class in the United States has passed only through
    its initial phases, almost exclusively in the sphere of the trade union movement (the CIO). The pre-war period, and
    then the war itself may temporarily interrupt this process of radicalization, especially if a considerable number of
    workers are absorbed into war industry. But this interruption of the process of radicalization cannot be of a long
    duration. The second stage of radicalization will assume a more sharply expressive character. The problem of forming
    an independent labor party will be put on the order of the day. Our transitional demands will gain great popularity.
    On the other hand, the fascist, reactionary tendencies will withdraw to the background, assuming a defensive
    position, awaiting a more favorable moment. This is the nearest perspective. No occupation is more completely
    unworthy than that of speculating whether or not we shall succeed in creating a powerful revolutionary leader party.
    Ahead lies a favorable perspective, providing all the justification for revolutionary activism. It is necessary to
    utilize the opportunities which are opening up and to build the revolutionary party.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Problem of Power Posed to the Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">The second world war poses the question of change of regimes more imperiously, more urgently than did the
    first war. It is first and foremost a question of the political regime. The workers are aware that democracy is
    suffering shipwreck everywhere, and that they are threatened by fascism even in those countries where fascism is as
    yet non-existent. The bourgeoisie of the democratic countries will naturally utilize this dread of fascism on the
    part of the workers, but, on the other hand, the bankruptcy of democracies, their collapse, their painless
    transformation into reactionary dictatorships compel the workers to pose before themselves the problem of power,
    render them responsive to the posing of the problem of power.</p>

<p>Reaction wields today such power as perhaps never before in the modern history of mankind. But it would be an
    inexcusable blunder to see only reaction. The historical process is a contradictory one. Under the cover of official
    reaction profound processes are taking place among the masses who are accumulating experience and are becoming
    receptive to new political perspectives. The old conservative tradition of the democratic state which was so
    powerful even during the era of the last imperialist war exists today only as an extremely unstable survival. On the
    eve of the last war the European workers had numerically powerful parties. But on the order of the day were put
    reforms, partial conquests, and not at all the conquest of power.</p>

<p>The American working class is still without a mass labor party even today. But the objective situation and the
    experience accumulated by the American workers can pose within a very brief period of time on the order of the day
    the question of the conquest of power. This perspective must be made the basis of our agitation. It is not merely a
    question of a position on capitalist militarism and of renouncing the defense of the bourgeois state but of directly
    preparing for the conquest of power and the defense of the proletarian fatherland.</p>

<p>May not the Stalinists turn out at the head of a new revolutionary upsurge and may they not ruin the revolution as
    they did in Spain and previously in China? It is of course impermissible to consider that such a possibility is
    excluded, for example in France. The first wave of the revolution has often, or more correctly, always carried to
    the top those &#8220;left&#8221; parties which have not managed to discredit themselves completely in the preceding
    period and which have an imposing political tradition behind them. Thus the February revolution raised up the
    Mensheviks, the S. R.&#8217;s who were the opponents of the revolution on its very eve. Thus the German revolution
    in November, 1918, raised to power the social democrats who were the irreconcilable opponents of revolutionary
    uprisings.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago Trotsky wrote in an article published by <strong>The New Republic</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is no epoch in human history so saturated with antagonisms as ours. Under a too high
    tension of class and international animosities, the &#8216;fuses&#8217; of democracy &#8216;blow out&#8217;. Hence
    the short-circuits of dictatorship. Naturally the weakest &#8216;interrupters&#8217; are the first to give way. But
    the force of internal and world controversies does not weaken: it grows. It is doubtful if it is destined to calm
    down, given that the process has so far only taken hold of the periphery of the capitalist world. Gout begins in the
    little finger of a hand or in the big toe, but once on the way it goes right to the heart.&#8221; (<strong>The New
        Republic</strong>, May 22, 1929)</p>

<br/>


<h4>The American Philistine Protests</h4>

<p class="fst">This was written at a time when the entire bourgeois democracy in each country believed that fascism was
    possible only in the backward countries which had not yet graduated from the school of democracy. The editorial
    board of <strong>The New Republic</strong>, which at that period had not yet been touched with the blessings of the
    GPU, accompanied Trotsky&#8217;s article with one of its own. The article is so characteristic of the average
    American philistine that we shall quote from it the most interesting passages.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In view of his personal misfortunes, the exiled Russian leader shows a remarkable power of
    detached analysis; but his detachment is that of the rigid Marxian, and seems to us to lack a realistic view of
    history-the very thing on which he prides himself. His notion that democracy is a fair-weather form of government,
    incapable of withstanding the storms of international or domestic controversy, can be supported (as he himself half
    admits) only by taking for your examples countries where democracy has never made more than the feeblest beginnings,
    and countries, moreover, in which the industrial revolution has hardly more than started.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Further on, the editorial board of <strong>The New Republic</strong> dismisses the instance of Kerensky&#8217;s
    democracy in Soviet Russia and why it failed to withstand the test of class contradictions arid yielded place to a
    revolutionary perspective. The periodical sagely writes:</p>

<p class="quotbe">&#8220;Kerensky&#8217;s weakness was an historic accident, which Trotsky cannot admit because there is
    no room in his mechanistic scheme for any such thing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Just like Dwight Macdonald, <strong>The New Republic</strong> accused the Marxists of being unable to
    understand history realistically owing to their orthodox or mechanistic approach to political events. <strong>The
        New Republic</strong> was of the opinion that fascism is the product of the backwardness of capitalism and not
    its over-ripeness. In the opinion of that periodical which, I repeat, was the opinion of the overwhelming majority
    of average democratic philistines, fascism is the lot of backward bourgeois countries. The sage editorial board did
    not even take the trouble of thinking about the question of why it was the universal conviction in the Nineteenth
    Century that backward countries must develop along the road of democracy. In any case, in the old capitalist
    countries democracy came into its sights at a time when the level of their economic development was not above but
    below the economic development of modern Italy. And what is more, in that era democracy represented the main highway
    of historical development which was entered by all countries one by one, the backward ones following the more
    advanced, and sometimes ahead of them. Our era on the contrary, is the era of democracy&#8217;s collapse, and
    moreover, the collapse begins with the weaker links but gradually extends to those which appeared strong and
    impregnable. Thus the orthodox or mechanistic, that is, the Marxist approach to events enabled us to forecast the
    course of developments many years in advance. On the contrary, the realistic approach of <strong>The New
        Republic</strong> represented the approach of a blind kitten. <strong>The New Republic</strong> followed up its
    critical attitude toward Marxism by falling under the influence of the most revolting caricature of Marxism, namely,
    Stalinism.</p>

<br/>


<h4>The Newest Crop of Philistines</h4>

<p class="fst">Most of the philistines of the newest crop base their attacks on Marxism on the fact that contrary to
    Marx&#8217;s prognosis fascism came instead of socialism. Nothing is more stupid and vulgar than this criticism.
    Marx demonstrated and proved that when capitalism reaches a certain level the only way out for society lies in the
    socialization of the means of production, i.e., socialism. He also demonstrated that in view of the class structure
    of society the proletariat alone is capable of solving this task in an irreconcilable revolutionary struggle against
    the bourgeoisie. He further demonstrated that for the fulfillment of this task the proletariat needs a revolutionary
    party. All his life Marx, and together with him and after him Engels, and after them Lenin, waged an irreconcilable
    struggle against those traits in proletarian parties, socialist parties which obstructed the solution of the
    revolutionary historical task. The irreconcilability of the struggle waged by Marx, Engels, and Lenin against
    opportunism, on the one side, and anarchism, on the other, demonstrates that they did not at all underestimate this
    danger. In what did it consist? In this, that the opportunism of the summits of the working class, subject to the
    bourgeoisie&#8217;s influence, could obstruct, slow down, make more difficult, postpone the fulfillment of the
    revolutionary task of the proletariat. It is precisely this condition of society that we are now observing. Fascism
    did not at all come &#8220;instead&#8221; of socialism. Fascism is the continuation of capitalism, an attempt to
    perpetuate its existence by means of the most bestial and monstrous measures. Capitalism obtained an opportunity to
    resort to fascism only because the proletariat did not accomplish the socialist revolution in time. The proletariat
    was paralyzed in the fulfillment of its task by the opportunist parties. The only thing that can be said is that
    there turned out to be more obstacles, more difficulties, more stages on the road of the revolutionary development
    of the proletariat than was foreseen by the founders of scientific socialism. Fascism and the series of imperialist
    wars constitute the terrible school in which the proletariat has to free itself of petty bourgeois traditions and
    superstitions, has to rid itself of opportunist, democratic and adventurist parties, has to hammer out and train the
    revolutionary vanguard and in this way prepare for the solving of the task apart from which there is not, and cannot
    be, any salvation for the development of mankind.</p>

<p>Eastman, if you please, has come to the conclusion that the concentration of the means of production in the hands of
    the state endangers his &#8220;freedom&#8221; and he has therefore decided to renounce socialism. This anecdote
    deserves being included in the text of a history of ideology. The socialization of the means of production is the
    only solution to the economic problem at the given stage of mankind&#8217;s development. The delay in solving this
    problem leads to the barbarism of fascism. All the intermediate solutions undertaken by the bourgeoisie with the
    help of the petty bourgeoisie have suffered a miserable and shameful fiasco. All this is absolutely uninteresting to
    Eastman. He noticed that his &#8220;freedom&#8221; (freedom of muddling, freedom of indifferentism, freedom of
    passivity, freedom of literary dilettantism) was being threatened from various sides, and he decided immediately to
    apply his own measure: renounce socialism. Astonishingly enough this decision exercised no influence either on Wall
    Street or on the policy of the trade unions. Life went its own way just as if Max Eastman had remained a socialist.
    It may be set down as a general rule that the more impotent is a petty bourgeois radical especially in the United
    States the more.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Fascism Has Not Conquered in France</h4>

<p class="fst">In France there is no fascism in the real sense of the term. The regime of the senile Marshal Petain
    represents a senile form of Bonapartism of the epoch of imperialist decline. But this regime too proved possible
    only after the prolonged radicalization of the French working class, which led to the explosion of June 1936, had
    failed to find a revolutionary way out. The Second and Third Internationals, the reactionary charlatanism of the
    &#8220;People&#8217;s Fronts&#8221; deceived and demoralized the working class. After five years of propaganda in
    favor of an alliance of democracies and of collective security, after Stalin&#8217;s sudden passage into Hitler&#8217;s
    camp, the French working class proved caught unaware. The war provoked a terrible disorientation and the mood of
    passive defeatism, or to put it more correctly, the indifferentism of an impasse. From this web of circumstances
    arose first the unprecedented military catastrophe and then the despicable Petain regime.</p>

<p>Precisely because Petain&#8217;s regime is senile Bonapartism, it contains no element of stability and can be
    overthrown by a revolutionary mass uprising much sooner than a fascist regime.</p>

<br/>


<h4>Especially Important to US Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">In every discussion of political topics the question invariably flares up: Shall we succeed in creating a
    strong party for the moment when the crisis comes? Might not fascism anticipate us? Isn&#8217;t a fascist stage of
    development inevitable? The successes of fascism easily make people lose all perspective, lead them to forget the
    actual conditions which made the strengthening and the victory of fascism possible. Yet a clear understanding of
    these conditions is of special importance to the workers of the United States. We may set it down as an historical
    law: Fascism was able to conquer only in those countries where the conservative labor parties prevented the
    proletariat from utilizing the revolutionary situation and seizing power. In Germany two revolutionary situations
    were involved: 1918-1919 and 1923-24. Even in 1929 a direct struggle for power on the part of the proletariat was
    still possible. In all these three cases the social democracy and the Comintern criminally and viciously disrupted
    the conquest of power and thereby placed society in an impasse. Only under these conditions and in this situation
    did the stormy rise of Fascism and its gaining of power prove possible.</p>
